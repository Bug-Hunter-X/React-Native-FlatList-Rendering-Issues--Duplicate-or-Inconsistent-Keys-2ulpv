This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an invalid or inconsistent key prop to its items.  The key prop is crucial for FlatList to efficiently update and render its items.  If keys are not unique, React Native might fail to track item changes correctly, leading to unexpected behavior like incorrect rendering or flickering.   Here's an example of incorrect usage:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate keys!
/>
```

In this code, the keyExtractor uses the `id` property, but some items have the same `id` (1). This results in inconsistent keys and can lead to various issues.
